## What we do / Services

We are passionate about software engineering and the complete process that leads to creating the web applications we deliver.

What makes us different is that we have the deep and wide experience of developing web applications as a team working together 9+ years.

We like to build a solid relationship with our clients. Understand their ideas and goals from the start and deliver them with adding our expertice of building rock-solid web applications that live up to the expecations that the client envisioned from the start.

The development process incorporates quick and flexible _Agile development_ methods:

Requirements -> Design -> Coding -> Testing -> Live

You would be working together with a Senior software developer team lead from the start to execute every step of the software development cycle. Work process is visualised on a Kanban board that the client always has access to for providing feedback and keeping track of the project.

We love good documentation but nobody likes writing it. _So we autogenerate it_. The API's we deliver are self documenting with [OpenAPI specification](https://www.openapis.org/) standard documentation and versioned with every change to keep compatibility easy.
